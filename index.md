## Learning out Loud

I keep hearing that code-blogging can be an important learning tool. As someone who struggles with impostor syndrome, though, I can't quite bring myself to write like someone who knows all the answers.

My [blog]({{ BASE_PATH }}{{ site.JB.archive_path }}), therefore, is going to be a chronicle of my mistakes and trivial idiocies; of the three-day blind alleys that one can go down when one's coding alone.

I think that this will, ultimately, add more to the internet than yet another reiteration of the Law of Demeter. The ungoogleable errors are always the most frustrating.

## Irregular Gentlewomen

I'm one of the two Irregular Gentlewomen, a feminist hacktivist collective with grand ambitions and too little free time with which to realize them.

Our current projects include [Interactive Feminist Bingo](http://irregulargentlewomen.github.com/feminist-bingo) and [Rated R for Rapist](http://github.com/irregulargentlewomen/ratedrforrapist). The former is what it says on the tin; the latter (which is currently pending release) allows users to quickly check whether anyone working on a given movie has publicly supported pardoning Roman Polanski, or collaborated with him since he fled justice.
