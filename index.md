## Irregular Gentlewomen

I'm one of the two Irregular Gentlewomen, a feminist hacktivist collective with grand ambitions and too little free time with which to realize them.

Our current projects include [Interactive Feminist Bingo](http://irregulargentlewomen.github.com/feminist-bingo) and [Rated R for Rapist](http://github.com/irregulargentlewomen/ratedrforrapist). The former is what it says on the tin; the latter (which is currently pending release) allows users to quickly check whether anyone working on a given movie has publicly supported pardoning Roman Polanski, or collaborated with him since he fled justice.
