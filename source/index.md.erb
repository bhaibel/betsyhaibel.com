## Me

Hi, I'm Betsy. I make code, writing, knit objects, theatrical sets, and really delicious cocktails.

I prefer to let my work speak for itself.

## Irregular Gentlewomen

I'm one of the two [Irregular Gentlewomen](http://irregulargentlewomen.org), a feminist hacktivist collective with grand ambitions and too little free time with which to realize them.

Our current projects include [Interactive Feminist Bingo](http://irregulargentlewomen.org/feminist-bingo) and [Rated R for Rapist](http://ratedrforrapist.org). The former is what it says on the tin; the latter allows users to quickly check whether anyone working on a given movie has publicly supported pardoning Roman Polanski, or collaborated with him since he fled justice.
