Ask a Geek Feminist
===================

I'm doing a blog series called "Ask a Geek Feminist." This series, modeled after a similar, defunct one on [Geek Feminism](http://geekfeminism.org), aims to provide a nonjudgemental space for people to ask questions.

Things I am trying to do:
-------------------------

- get prompts for writing ideas
- answer questions people don't know how to look for answers to
- answer questions, even basic ones, in a nonjudgemental and low-jargon way

Things I am not interested in doing:
------------------------------------

- being men's personal Google
- watering down concepts in the interest of accessibility
- doing this to the exclusion of things I find more interesting

How I'm doing this:
-------------------

Periodically (alternating with a series called Ask a (Female) Senior Engineer) I'll be putting out an open call on Twitter for questions. A few days later, a post answering one of them will go up. (If two overlap, I might try to kill two birds with one stone.)

Right now, I plan to call for questions every other Friday and put up the post the following Sunday night. This plan is subject to change without notice.

Question Guidelines:
--------------------

- Any on-topic question is okay, no matter how 101. However, I'll mostly be picking which question I answer based on how interesting I find it to write about. Post-101-level questions are more interesting to me.
- All good-faith questions about or relating to feminist, anti-sexual-violence, or queer-rights issues count as "on-topic." However, I'm going to particularly focus on questions about feminism within the tech industry or within "geek spaces" like science fiction, gaming, etc. 

Boundaries:
-----------

- I don't want to be anyone's personal Google. If I've answered a question of yours recently (say, in the past three months or so), please don't submit another.
- I'm not going to repeat myself. Please check the [question archive](/blog/categories/ask-a-geek-feminist) before asking a question. Also look through Julie Pagano's [Feminism 101 FAQ](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/02/101-off-limits/)
- I'm only interested in good-faith questions. If you sound like you're more interested in arguing with a feminist than learning, then I won't take your question. If you phrase the question aggressively, ditto.
